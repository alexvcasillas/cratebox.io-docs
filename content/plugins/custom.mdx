---

With cratebox you have the ability to create your own plugins to handle state, views & actions in your own way. This gives you (the developer) the flexibility of using it's own business logic the way you see fit.

The following example comes with a very simple implementation of a plugin for a store with an object type state based. You can use this as a base for your plugin and enhance it the way you consider better.

```typescript
import { createStore, Store } from "cratebox";

/**
 * Define this store's shape!
 */
type UserState = {
  name?: string,
  lastName?: string,
};

/**
 * User state object that matches the User State Type
 */
const userState: UserState = {};

/**
 * Define User Views
 *  – it's like computed properties!
 */
type UserViews = {
  fullName: string,
}

/**
 * User Views function of state that returns
 * and object with the user views type
 */
const userViews = (state: UserState): UserViews => ({
  fullName: `${state.name || "John"} ${state.lastName || "Doe"}`,
});


/**
 * Define User Actions
 *  – You'll be able to change the state within this actions only!
 */
type UserActions = {
  changeName(name: string): void;
  changeLastName(lastName: string): void;
}

/**
 * User Actions function of state that returns
 * an object with the user actions type
 */
const userActions = (state: UserState): UserActions => ({
  changeName(name: string) {
    state.name = name;
  },
  changeLastName(lastName: string) {
    state.lastName = lastName;
  }
});

/**
 * Create the store
 * and then export it to use it somewhere else!
 */
const userStore = createStore(
  userState,
  userViews,
  userActions,
  <UserState, UserViews, UserActions>(
    userState: UserState,
    userViews: (state: UserState) => UserViews,
    userActions: (state: UserState) => UserActions
    ): Store<UserState, UserViews, UserActions> => {

      const proxiedState: T = new Proxy<any>(state, {
        get(target: object, prop: string, receiver: any) {
          return Reflect.get(target, prop, receiver);
        },
        set(object: object, prop: string, value: any) {
          return Reflect.set(object, prop, value);
        },
      });

      const proxiedViews: V = new Proxy<any>(state, {
        get(_: object, prop: string, __: any) {
          return views && views(proxiedState)[prop];
        },
        set(_: object, __: string, ___: any) {
          throw new Error('Cannot force override a view');
        },
      });

      const proxiedActions: A = new Proxy<any>(state, {
        get(_: object, prop: string, __: any) {
          return actions && actions(proxiedState)[prop];
        },
        set(_: object, __: string, ___: any) {
          throw new Error('Cannot force override an action');
        },
      });

      return {
        state: proxiedState,
        views: proxiedViews,
        actions: proxiedActions,
      };
  }
);
```
