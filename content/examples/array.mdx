The following example shows how to create a simple todo list of top-level type `Array<Todo>` to keep some task data within it, make use of views and actions to dispatch changes to the state.

```typescript
import { createStore } from "cratebox";
import uuid from "uuid/v4";

/**
 * Define this store's shape!
 */
type Todo = {
  id?: string,
  title?: string,
  done?: boolean,
}

type TodoState = Todo[];

/**
 * User state object that matches the User State Type
 */
const todoState: TodoState = [];

/**
 * Define User Views
 *  – it's like computed properties!
 */
type TodoViews = {
  done: Todo[],
}

/**
 * User Views function of state that returns
 * and object with the user views type
 */
const todoViews = (state: TodoState): TodoViews => ({
  done: state.filter(todo => todo.done),
});


/**
 * Define User Actions
 *  – You'll be able to change the state within this actions only!
 */
type TodoActions = {
  addTodo(todo: Todo): void;
  removeTodo(id: string): void;
}

/**
 * User Actions function of state that returns
 * an object with the user actions type
 */
const todoActions = (state: TodoState): TodoActions => ({
  addTodo(todo: Todo) {
    state = [...state, { id: uuid(), ...todo }];
    // state.push({ id: uuid(), ...todo });
  },
  removeTodo(id: string) {
    state = state.filter(todo => todo.id !== id);
  },
});

/**
 * Create the store
 * and then export it to use it somewhere else!
 */
const todoStore = createStore(todoState, todoViews, todoActions);

export default todoStore;
```
