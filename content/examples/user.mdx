The following example shows how to create a simple user store to keep some user data within it, make use of views and actions to dispatch changes to the state.

```typescript
import { createStore } from "cratebox";

/**
 * Define this store's shape!
 */
type UserState = {
  name?: string,
  lastName?: string,
};

/**
 * User state object that matches the User State Type
 */
const userState: UserState = {};

/**
 * Define User Views
 *  – it's like computed properties!
 */
type UserViews = {
  fullName: string,
}

/**
 * User Views function of state that returns
 * and object with the user views type
 */
const userViews = (state: UserState): UserViews => ({
  fullName: `${state.name || "John"} ${state.lastName || "Doe"}`,
});


/**
 * Define User Actions
 *  – You'll be able to change the state within this actions only!
 */
type UserActions = {
  changeName(name: string): void;
  changeLastName(lastName: string): void;
}

/**
 * User Actions function of state that returns
 * an object with the user actions type
 */
const userActions = (state: UserState): UserActions => ({
  changeName(name: string) {
    state.name = name;
  },
  changeLastName(lastName: string) {
    state.lastName = lastName;
  }
});

/**
 * Create the store
 * and then export it to use it somewhere else!
 */
const userStore = createStore(
  userState,
  userViews,
  userActions
);

export default userStore;
```
