  Cratebox is a plugin based state management library.
</p>

* **Declarative**: with cratebox you will create almost effortless stores to keep your state in a global level.
* **Plugin-based**: create your own plugins to handle state, views & actions the way you want or let Cratebox use it's defaults so you don't have to worry about anything.

## Installation

Cratebox can be installer into your project with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) or [npm](https://npmjs.com) with the following commands:

```
yarn add cratebox
```

```
npm install cratebox
```

## Usage & API

Cratebox comes with one named export called **createStore** which is a function with the following signature:

```typescript
interface createStore<T, V, A>(
  state: T,
  views?: (state: T) => V,
  actions?: (state: T) => A,
  plugin?: Plugin,
) => Store<T, V, A>;
```

Let's proceed to describe the signature a little.

* **createStore**: will take three parameters of types T, V and A which will be used to infer types to give you a good developer experience when using [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
* **state**: will be one of the following types:
  * **object**: a regular object type shape to manage state.
  * **Map< T, V >**: a top-level map type of the types you'd like to use as key/value pair.
  * **Array< T >**: a top-level array type of the type you'd like to use as the elements stored in.
* **views**: views are a function of state and are used to create computed properties.
* **actions**: actions are a function of state and should be used to update state from within this function. Note that this is not a rule but it's recommended that you only update the state though actions so you can keep track of where and when you're applying changes to a store. The default plugin that comes with Cratebox will ensure that you don't apply changes directly to state at any point and only through actions.
* **plugin**: plugins are a way to handle your own state, views & actions logic for the given store. If you don't pass any plugin at the creation time, Cratebox will use it's default plugin for you.
